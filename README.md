# Connect4 FPGA PCB CAO

This repository houses the design and implementation files for a Connect 4 game developed on a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), inclusive of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design and Computer-Aided Design (CAD) files.

## Overview

The project employs VHDL for FPGA development, integrating digital design principles into the classic board game. It includes Quartus project files, media, and Altium Designer files for the PCB, along with SolidWorks part files.

## Repository Structure

- **/Quartus**: Contains Quartus II project files.
- **/media**: Media files including images and videos showcasing the project.
- **AltiumDesigner.zip**: PCB design files in Altium Designer format.
- **SolidWorks Files**: Includes all SLDPRT files for 3D modeling of components.
